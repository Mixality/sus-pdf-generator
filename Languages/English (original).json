    "VariantGeneratorDescription" : "The original SUS questionnaire by Brooke that was developed in 1986. It is intended to be used with the descriptor \"system\" and uses the word \"cumbersome\" in question 8. Despite good internal reliability, consequent research suggested that the word \"cumbersome\" can lead to comprehension problems with some participants. While the original, this version is not the most commonly used variant of the SUS today.",
