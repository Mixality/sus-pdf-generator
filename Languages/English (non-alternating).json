    "VariantGeneratorDescription" : "The non-alternating SUS questionnaire developed by Sauro et al. has all statements worded positively. Therefore, the even items 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were rephrased. While the internal reliability is nearly identical with the original SUS and the validation efforts showed comparable scores, researchers should be careful using this variant. It differs from all other versions: SUS scores are calculated differently, Item-level benchmarks and comparisons are not possible, and it is <b>not compatible</b> with the SUS Analysis Toolkit.",
