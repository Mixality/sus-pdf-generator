    "VariantGeneratorDescription" : "The revised english SUS questionnaire, published by Bangor et al. in 2008, replaces the word \"cumbersome\" with \"awkward\" for better comprehension and is intended to be used with the descriptor \"product\". It is likely the most widely used variant of the SUS and many of the translations and consequent variants are based on this variant. This version was validated through subsequent research and shows great internal reliability.",
